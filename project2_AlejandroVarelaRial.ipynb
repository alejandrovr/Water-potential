    "This project aims to produce a file which, once superposed with the simulated protein in VMD, shows the water potential of the system. This is achieved by creating an imaginary 3D grid around the simulations and counting how many times oxigen atoms from water molecules appear in a voxel of this 3D grid along all the frames in the simulations. After normalize and use the chemical potential ecuation one can obtain a .cube file with writeVoxels function. "

As all simulations are aligned to the first one, we can attribute water distribution to the interaction of the protein and the water. \n",

In the \"dense\" function, you can see a condition that does not allow negative coordinates to enter values in the matrix. Less than ten molecules are excluded with this method.\n",
